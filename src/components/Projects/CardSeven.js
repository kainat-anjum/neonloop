      <h2>Optimizing Hashing Algorithms for BlockChain Systems</h2>
      <p>
        The purpose of this project is to provide the FPGA implementation of the
        X16R algorithm intends to solve this problem by constantly disrupting
        the ordering of the hashing algorithms. Redesign and optimize the
        hashing algorithms on FPGA e.g., Keccak, SHA-3 and Blake to use to find
        the hash for cryptocurrency.
